# Portfolio 2025

My new portfolio for 2025, coming soon. Here will be the changes:

- Svelte instead of React
- Three.js instead of react-three-fiber (more control)
- 3D section should make more sense (2024 one was so random lol, gotta plan it better with a better theme)
    - (i was rushing on making a portfolio website in 2024, no rush this year ...)

Might work on this during the summer...
